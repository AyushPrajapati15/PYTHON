<!-- List Data Structure -->

What is the requirement of List and How List came into the picture?

Ans: By using Fundamental data type like int, float, complex, bool and str we can store one value at a time but if you want to store multiple value at a time into as a single entity then we may can use list (Not only list we can use other collection also), to overcome this problem list came into the picture.

<!-- Introduction to List: -->

• List is an inbuild data structure in Python, which is used to store heterogenous data item means dissimilar data item.

• List is acting as a container where we can store comma separated
value in between square brackets.


<!-- Example:- -->

<!-- creation of list directly -->

l=[23,33,'Alice',True,5.5]
l=[]  ---> Empty list

 <!-- creation of lists Dynamically using eval() function -->
 input("Enter a list") # by default it is string

int(input("Enter a lists")) # now it will take integer type

 so to create a list using eval function we have to tpe cast it to eval()
 l=eval(input("Enter a lists))

 <!-- Enter a lists [10,20,30,'alice','bob'] in the same way we have to enter the lists inside [] bracket  -->

<!--   creation of lists using list() -->
l= list((20,50,40,60))

 <!-- creation of lists using range() -->
 l= list(range(10,21))

 # NOTE := "List can hold any complex datatype like dictionary,tuple,etc"

 <!-- #  creation of lists using split() -->
 split- it is basically used to make a list of a string by default wherever it will get a space it will make listi out of it, but we can pass the value such as split(''-) it menas where there is a '-' it will make a list of it

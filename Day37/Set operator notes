<!-- Introduction to set & its characteristics -->

• Set data structure is Just like List but in set duplicates are not allowed and set does not maintain order.
• Set is a unorder collection.
• In set data structure we cant apply indexing and slicing concept.
• We can store heterogenous data item.
• Set is mutable in nature based on our requirement we can modification operations. 
• {} curly brackets is used to create set data structure.

<!-- Note -->
We can modify set but we cant modify its content, hence set is mutable but its elements are immutable in nature.

<!-- Set methods -->
 <!-- 1.add() -->
• used to add an element into set
• it has no effect if the element is already present

 <!-- 2.update() -->
• It is used to add multiple elements into set
Here we will add iterable object not individual element like List,Tuple,Range etc.

<!-- 3.remove() -->
• it is used to remove the specified element from the list
• if the specified element is not present then it will raise keyerror

<!-- discard() -->
• it is exactly same as remove() but the difference is here if the specified element is not present then wont raise keyerror

<!-- Introduction to set & its characteristics -->

. Set data structure is Just like List but in set duplicates are not allowed and set does not maintain order.
. Set is a unorder collection.
. In set data structure we cant apply indexing and slicing concept.
. We can store heterogenous data item.
.  Set is mutable in nature based on our requirement we can modification operations. 
. {} curly brackets is used to create set data structure.

<!-- Note -->
We can modify set but we cant modify its content, hence set is mutable but its elements are immutable in nature.

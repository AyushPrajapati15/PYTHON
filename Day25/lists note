it is used to add all the elements of one list into another list

# reverse():-
it is used to reverse a list

# sort():-
it is used for sorting or arranging elements either in ascending or descending order.
if we will provide reverse=True, then it will print in descending order
if it contains numer then it will work based on ascending order,but if the list contain string then it will work in alphabet order.
if list contain heteroenous(number,alphabet) elements then in this case sort() will not work, but in python 2 it will forst sort number then alphabet

# clear():-

(del l ) it will delete the list along with the variable

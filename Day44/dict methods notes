<!-- 7.setdefault() -->
Working Process
-->Here as an argument we will provide key and value
-->It is used to return the value associated with that specified key.
--> If the key is not available then key and value will be added as new item to the dictionary


<!-- 8.update -->
Suppose we have two list then, it is used to add all the items of d2 in d1.
<!-- 9.copy -->
it is used to copy(shallow cop) all the items from one dict to another dict.

both dict are pointing to diff memory location so if we will make any changes on any particular dict it will not reflect to another dict.

if we are using assignment operator(=) then it is ^pointing to different memory location so if we make any changes to one it will reflect to other

<!-- 10.clear -->

it is basically used to remove all the items of a dict but then our dict will become empty.

<!-- 11.fromkeys() -->
It is used to create a new dictionary from given iterable (list, tuple,range etc.) and value ( it is optional).
